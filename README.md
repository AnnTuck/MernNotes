# MernNotes
This is a simple note sending app written by Ann Tuck using the MERN.

Give it a try and add your note to the inbox of inane messages.

This app uses React.js and MongoDB database.

My todo list:

1. Show recent messages at that top of the inbox.
2. Prevent submission of duplicate messages.
